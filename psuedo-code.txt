# Load reference input

Load reference GWAS summary stats

(Optional) Load genomic (exon, intron) features
    merge with reference stats

Load LD scores
    make percentile bins of equal size
    merge with reference stats

Split reference SNPs into test SNPs and null SNPs

# Exclude test SNPs that are similar to each other (to reduce multiple testing)

(Optional) Exclude by close proximity
    Sort test SNPs by ascending P-value
    For each test SNP
        Find other test SNPs with defined genomic window
        Exclude proximal SNPs from analysis

(Optional) Exclude by high LD (r2)
    Sort test SNPs by ascending P-value
    For each test SNP
        Find other test SNPs that have r2 > set value
        Exclude LD SNPs from analysis

# Sample null distribution

For each test SNP

    Read test SNP profile: maf, position, ldscore_bin, genomic features
    Initiate copy of null SNPs as candidate sample
    Exclude from candidate sample if maf not within set range
    Exclude from candidate sample if not in same ldscore bin
    Exclude from candidate sample if candidate is too close to test SNP (default: 1Mb)
    Exclude from candidate sample if additional genomic features dont match

    if candidate sample size (cs) < desired sample size (ss), set ss = cs
    randomly sample (with replacement) from candidate sample to make null distribution

# Load and test second phenotype GWAS summary stats

Load enricment test GWAS summary stats

For each test SNP
    compare test statistic to null distribution
    count = how many times test statistic is more extreme than null (upper/lower/two-tailed)
    p = 1 - ( count / size of null dist )

Produce results table
Apply multiple testing corrections
(todo) Plot test SNP association p-value vs. enrichment p-value
